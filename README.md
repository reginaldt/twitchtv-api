# Twitchtv API

A simple application that displays list of twitch tv users and status. One of the intermediate front end projects of [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)


# User Stories

- I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
- I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
- If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
- I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account (or the account never existed).
